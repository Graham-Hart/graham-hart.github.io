          <p>Start the game by marking cells as "alive" or "dead". Click to mark a cell as alive, shift-click to mark it
               as dead. Once you're done, press space. Every timestep, cells will re-evaluate their state based on these
               conditions:
          </p>
          <p class="rules">
               <br>
               <b>DEAD: </b>
               <br>
               <br>
               -- If a cell has less than 2 neighbors, it will die.
               <br>
               -- If a cell has greater than 3 neighbors, it will die.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <b>REBORN: </b>
               <br>
               <br>
               -- If a dead cell has exactly 3 neighbors, it will become alive
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               If none of these cases are true, the cell will keep it's state.
          </p>
          <p>Keep your cells alive for as long as possible!</p>
